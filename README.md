# NextCloudDeployment


This repository contains the files and exercises for the Cloud Exam, organized into BASIC and ADVANCED tasks, along with the project report.

The BASIC folder contains a documentation for running the NextCloud service and a directory *nextcloud_docker* where there are all the needed bash scripts and yaml file.

The ADVANCE folder is divided in *MODULE 1* and *MODULE 2*, since there were two tasks for this part of the exam. 

* On Module 1 there is the ReadMe to run and deploy the service and a folder *deploy_nextcloud* with all the necessary code
* On Module 2 there is the ReadMe to deploy the service, a Vagrantfile for the setup of the 2 VMs and the necessary code to run the OSU Benchmark tests.
